// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers
a = 2
b = 3
sum = 5

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

# check if a number is Even or Odd 
a = 2 
b = 3 
if sum of a + b is equal to even number
print ("Even") 
else:  
print ("Odd")

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.
 Userinputs = (5 random numbers)
  num = 3 
  num = 5 
  num = 7 
  num = 9
  num = 11  

b) Calculate the average of the five numbers. 
Numbers = [3, + 5, + 7, + 9, + 11]
Sum of the five numbers = 35 
Average of the five numbers = 35 divided by 5 equals to 7.
 
  
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
# find the minimum of the five entered Numbers
  if find the minimum number: 
   print ("minimum number") 
 if find the maximum number
   print ("miximum number")
 else:
   print ("not found")
    
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are 
In Step B:
   5 different Random numberes were combined from users.
   Performed addition of those random numbers.
   Average them out by dividing by the total of five numbers. 

In Step C :
 Starting from hash to indicate what we are going to find. 
 Wrote conditional requirement if met then print desire answer.
 else is there if right instructions are not found then print other answer.
